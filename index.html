<h1>Projects</h1>
    <p>I have done a couple of projects some of which were a disappointment
       to me since they did perform the objectives required.Above all i have
       done a project recently that is quite good to my point of view.Here is a
       link to my project;https://wangilamain.github.io/portfolio/ </p>
    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>My name is Sharon Wwawira.I am twenty two years old.I am a student at
       Moringa School doing software development(Programming).
       I have studied upto university level(undergraduate). At the univesity,
       i studied Computer Science .
       I decided to take a path in the programming field since I have always had
       passion for coding and also need a job.I love sleeping and eating.Am a good
       singer and dancer as well.I also do alot of bead work as a hobby.I enjoy
       watching movies and alone time.This helps me think alot about myself in
